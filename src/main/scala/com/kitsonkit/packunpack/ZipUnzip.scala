/**
 * Object that takes a string of similar consecutive letters (all letters must be same case) and transforms this into a sequence consisting of the count of each consecutive letter followed by that letter. If a letter only appears once, do not apply a count. This should also demonstrate tail recursion. Also write a method that reverses this so that the output of the first method ran with this method will return the original result.
